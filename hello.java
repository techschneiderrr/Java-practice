//Class is a keyword used to declare a class in java
//Public is an access modifier keyword in java
//Static -> if we declare any method as static then its said to be a static method 
//       -> there is no need to create an object to invoke the static method
// Main() -> method is executed by the jvm so there is no need to create an object to invoke the main method as it saves memory
//        -> represent the starting point of the program
//Void -  its a return type, which means the method doesnt return any value and is null
//String[] args -> is used for command line arguments
//System.out.println -> System is a class, out is an object of PrintStream class, println is a method of the PrintStream class
